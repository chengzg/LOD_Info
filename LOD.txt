lighting LOD:
texture LOD
mesh LOD

static LOD, 
dynamic LOD,


discrete LOD
    There is no way to support a smooth transition between LOD levels at this level, although alpha blending or morphing can be used to avoid visual poppopping

continuous  LOD



Topology keeping algorithm: 
    Manifold, realistic
non-topology keeping algorithm
    large amount reduced, looks differently

Point Cloud VS Mesh


polygon mesh processing
Level of detail for 3D graphics

Computing a representative:
    Average/Median vertex position
    Error quadrics

After reduction, display side by side

Repaire, welding consists of mergng vertices that are closer than a certain distance from each other

Polygon Optimization
    1. Quality
    2. Scalability
    3. Control
    4. Flexibility
    5. Can it keep the UV texture as well as normal, color etc?

Instant Meshes
    fewer quads
    remesh quads

Simmplygon
    1. fewer triangles
    2. LESS OBJECTS
    3. Combining and creating new textures  
    4. Optimizing animation
