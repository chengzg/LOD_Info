normal deviation to reduce the mesh
vertex welding
T-junction welding
lock-boundary
high-polygon details can be transferred to the low polygon with uv set
optimization problem, many different ways to set the target, percent, distance, deviation, others
remesh heal the geometry error automatically
    Clipping plane to remove un-needed parts

Compare Remesh Vs Simplification, usually way of doing LOD

UV shell padding space blending the colors from one shell to another shell

T = normalize(dx/du, dy/du, dz/du)
N = T X normalize(dx/dv, dy/dv, dz/dv)
B = N x T
Tangent space is just a local coordinate system.
tangent space:切空间，就是反应模型空间坐标相对纹理左边的变换坡度
tangent space normal mapping是什么？

How are the current texture coordiates preservation of existing tools? 
cage vs low-poly, what's the difference?

Simplygon: 
Silhouette vs hard edge, what's the difference for them?
Welding Threshold, to weld vertices within this distrance, use small values

Able to snap them together and display them side by side
